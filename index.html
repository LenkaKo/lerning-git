        <p>All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray<br>
        I've been for a walk on a winter's day<br>
        I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.<br>
        <b>California dreamin</b>, oh, on such a winter's day<br>
        All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray<br>
        I've been for a walk on a winter's day<br>
        I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.<br>
        Oh, California dreamin', on such a winter's day</p>
        <p>I stopped into a church I passed along the way<br>
        Well, I got down on my knees<br>
        And I pretended to pray<br>
        You know the preacher likes the cold<br>
        He knows I'm gonna stay<br>
        <b>California dreamin</b>, oh, oh, on such a winter's day</p>
        <p>I'd be safe and warm<br>
        I'd be safe and warm<br>
        I'd be safe and warm<br>
        I'd be safe and warm<br></p>
        <p>All the leaves are brown (all the leaves are brown)<br>
        And the sky is gray (and the sky is gray)<br>
        I've been for a walk, oh, on a winter's day<br>
        If I didn't go, I could leave today<br>
        <b>California dreamin</b>, on such a winter's day<br>
        Oh, on such a winter's day<br>
        On such a winter's day<br></p>
